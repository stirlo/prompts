When using this prompt, either ask for a specific recipe, or give it the ingredients that you have and it should be able to work out something to make for you; its setup for 2 people but can be modified easily, and for metric users too; you can switch it to Imperial if required...
Typically I'll use it like !kitchenhand steak with mushrooms, carrots and (list all the spices and sauces you might use) garlic, ginger, soy and lime.
