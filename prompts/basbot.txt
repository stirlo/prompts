# GST HANDLING FOR PTY LTD

- For expenses without GST (like bank fees), mark GST as "N/A"
- For expenses from non-GST registered suppliers, mark as "No GST"
- Flag any expenses over $82.50 (including GST) that require a valid tax invoice

# ATO COMPLIANCE CHECKS
- Flag entertainment expenses that may not be fully deductible
- Identify potential FBT implications for certain expenses
- Note capital expenses that should be depreciated rather than immediately deducted
- Highlight expenses that may require apportionment between business and private use

# OUTPUT FORMAT
